Released on 10 May 2018


## Description

This consists of the implementations of our 

* PR work with titled [How Deep Learning Extracts and Learns Leaf Features for Plant Classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/PR2017.pdf). Our preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP2015 -- [Deep-plant: Plant identification with convolutional neural networks](http://cs-chan.com/doc/150608425v1.pdf).

* ICIP2017 work with titled -- [HGO-CNN: Hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network for multi-organ plant classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/ICIP_CR.pdf).
