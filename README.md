Released on May 19, 2017

## Description

This consists of the implementations of our 

* PR2017 with titled [How Deep Learning Extracts and Learns Leaf Features for Plant Classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/PR2017.pdf). Our preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP2015 -- [Deep-plant: Plant identification with convolutional neural networks](http://cs-chan.com/doc/150608425v1.pdf). Please refer to the [PR2017](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/PR2017) folder.

* T-IP (Accepted) with titled -- Multi-Organ Plant Classification based on Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. Our preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP2017 -- [HGO-CNN: Hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network for multi-organ plant classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/ICIP_CR.pdf). Please refer to the [HGO-CNN](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/HGO-CNN) and [PlantStructNet](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/PlantStructNet) folders.
